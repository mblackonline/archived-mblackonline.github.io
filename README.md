## About Me

I'm Matt Black, an aspiring cloud engineer/DevOps professional. I'm always eager to learn new things and share my knowledge with others.

I created this site to improve my web development skills, share my knowledge, and connect with fellow technology enthusiasts.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to connect.

## My GitHub Projects

* [Weather Lookup Tool](https://github.com/mblackonline/weather-lookup-tool) - A simple Python program that allows users to look up weather data using the Open Weather API.
* [JP Morgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience](https://github.com/mblackonline/JP-Morgan-Chase_Software-Engineering-Virtual-Experience) - This project helped me gain hands-on experience with implementing Python, TypeScript, Node.js, and React in a web application that visualized stock trading data. It also gave me a good opportunity to practice presentation skills by completing a short video discussing my analysis of the data and my rationale for setting trigger thresholds.

* [AWS Web App Tool](https://github.com/mblackonline/aws-web-app_ipv4-to-binary) - A simple AWS serverless web app that allows you to convert an IPv4 address into its binary equivalent.
* [CD-Squared Tech](https://github.com/mblackonline/cd-squared-tech) - I've been fortunate to meet a great team of developers in my local community (see [CD Tech](https://www.meetup.com/chadevs/events/xdnzftyfckbbc/)) and I am contributing to the team's GitHub project.

## My Goals for the Future

I'm currently working on building a portfolio of projects to showcase my programming and cloud engineering/DevOps skills. Additionally, I'm actively looking for opportunities to contribute to open-source projects.

In the future, I hope to work as a cloud engineer and leverage technology to make the world a better place.
